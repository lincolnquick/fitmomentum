# Calculations and Assumptions for FitMomentum
## 1. Caloric Deficit and Weight Loss
### How is a calorie deficit related to fat loss?
A calorie deficit of approximately 3,500 calories is commonly associated with the loss of 1 pound of fat. This is based on the energy content of adipose tissue, though individual factors such as metabolism and activity level can affect accuracy.  
*Formula:*  
> Weight Change (lbs) = Total Calorie Deficit / 3,500  
> 3,500 kcal deficit → 1 lb weight loss or 7,700 kcal deficit → 1 kg weight loss  
*(Wishnofsky, 1958)*

## 2. Inaccuracies of the Wishnofsky Model
### Why is the Wishnofsky Model inaccurate?
While the Wishnofsky Model is a simple and widely cited "rule of thumb" in nutrition, it oversimplifies the complex dynamics of weight loss. According to modern research, including the study by Thomas et al. (2014), the model's assumptions are flawed:

1. **Energy Content of Weight Change Varies:**
   - Weight loss is not always derived primarily from fat stores, particularly during the early phases of dieting when glycogen, protein, and water are also lost.
   - The energy content of weight change is lower than 3,500 kcal/lb during early dieting and may increase over time as fat becomes the primary energy source.

2. **Metabolic Adaptations Occur:**
   - Resting energy expenditure (REE) decreases with weight loss due to reductions in body mass and adaptive thermogenesis.
   - Non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) and the thermic effect of food (TEF) also decrease, further slowing weight loss.

3. **Dynamic Phases of Weight Loss:**
   - **Early Phase:** Rapid initial weight loss due to glycogen and water depletion.
   - **Later Phase:** Slower, fat-dominated weight loss as metabolic adaptations reduce energy expenditure.

4. **Weight Loss Plateaus:**
   - As energy intake decreases, energy expenditure adjusts downward until a new equilibrium is reached, causing weight loss to plateau.

### Practical Context: Why the Wishnofsky Model is Still Helpful
Despite its inaccuracies, the Wishnofsky Model serves as a helpful **rule of thumb** for:
- Setting initial weight loss expectations for short-term diets.
- Simplifying complex energy balance principles for general audiences.
- Offering a starting point for calorie deficit calculations in apps like FitMomentum.

### How can FitMomentum apply this knowledge?
- Clearly communicate the limitations of the 3,500 kcal/lb rule in the app's informational resources.
- Use dynamic prediction models (e.g., Thomas Model) for more accurate long-term weight loss projections.
- Incorporate messages explaining why weight loss slows over time, especially when users encounter plateaus.

## 3. Body Mass Index (BMI)
### How do you calculate BMI?
BMI is calculated by dividing a person’s weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters.  
*Formula:*  
> BMI = W / H^2  
> Where:  
> W = Weight in kg  
> H = Height in meters

---

## 4. Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)
### How is BMR calculated?
The Mifflin-St Jeor Equation is one of the most reliable methods:  
*Formula:*  
> BMR = 10 * W + 6.25 * H - 5 * A + S  
> Where:  
> W = Weight in kg  
> H = Height in cm  
> A = Age in years  
> S = +5 for males, -161 for females  

*(Mifflin et al., 1990)*

## 5. Thomas Model for Predicting Weight Change
### What is the Thomas model?
The Thomas model is a dynamic formula used to predict changes in body composition (fat mass and fat-free mass) over time in adults. Unlike the static 3,500-calorie rule, this model accounts for physiological factors such as sex, age, height, and metabolic adaptations. The equations provide separate predictions for men and women, considering changes in fat mass, fat-free mass, and metabolic rate.

### Equations
#### Females:
\[
FFM(t) = -72.1 + 2.5F(t) - 0.04(A_0 + t/365) + 0.7H - 0.002F(t)(A_0 + t/365) - 0.01F(t)H - 0.04F(t)^2 + 0.0003F(t)^2(A_0 + t/365) + 0.0000004F(t)^4 + 0.0002F(t)^3 + 0.0003F(t)^2H - 0.000002F(t)^3H
\]

#### Males:
\[
FFM(t) = -71.7 + 3.6F(t) - 0.04(A_0 + t/365) + 0.7H - 0.002F(t)(A_0 + t/365) - 0.01F(t)H + 0.00003F(t)^2(A_0 + t/365) - 0.07F(t)^2 + 0.0006F(t)^3 - 0.000002F(t)^4 + 0.0003F(t)^2H - 0.000002F(t)^3H
\]

### Terms and Variables
- \(FFM(t)\): Fat-free mass (kg) at time \(t\) (in days).
- \(F(t)\): Fat mass (kg) at time \(t\).
- \(H\): Height (cm).
- \(A_0\): Baseline age (years).
- \(t\): Time (days) since the start of the weight change period.

### Key Features
- The model separates fat mass (\(F(t)\)) and fat-free mass (\(FFM(t)\)), offering more precise predictions of body composition.
- It accounts for age-related and height-related differences in weight change.
- The dynamic nature of the model allows for realistic, time-dependent weight predictions.

## 6. Energy Balance Principle
### How is energy balance calculated?
The Energy Balance Principle is defined as:
\[
R = I - E
\]
Where:  
- \(R\): Rate of weight change (caloric balance, kcal/day).  
- \(I\): Caloric intake (kcal/day).  
- \(E\): Caloric expenditure (kcal/day).  

This principle demonstrates that weight loss occurs when energy expenditure exceeds energy intake.

**References:**  
- Fogler, H. (1986). *Elements of Chemical Reaction Engineering* (4th ed.). Prentice Hall.

---

## 7. Rate of Energy Expenditure
### What are the components of energy expenditure?
The rate of energy expenditure (\(E\)) is composed of four main factors:
\[
E = DIT + PA + RMR + SPA
\]
Where:  
- \(DIT\): Dietary-induced thermogenesis (kcal/day).  
- \(PA\): Volitional physical activity (kcal/day).  
- \(RMR\): Resting metabolic rate (kcal/day).  
- \(SPA\): Spontaneous physical activity (kcal/day).  

This equation breaks down energy expenditure into measurable components that can be adjusted to understand how changes in diet or activity affect total caloric burn.

### How can this be applied in FitMomentum?
- **Caloric Balance:** Display users' caloric balance using \(R = I - E\).  
- **Activity Breakdown:** Show a breakdown of caloric expenditure into \(DIT\), \(PA\), \(RMR\), and \(SPA\), helping users understand which areas contribute most to their energy use.

## 9. Healthy Weight Loss Recommendations

### What is a healthy rate of weight loss?
- Aim for a weight loss of **1–2 pounds per week**, which is considered safe and sustainable.
- This equates to a caloric deficit of **500–750 kcal/day**.

### Why is modest weight loss important?
Losing **5–10% of your total body weight** can significantly improve health outcomes:
- **Lower blood pressure** and improved cholesterol levels.
- **Better blood sugar control** and reduced risk of Type 2 Diabetes.
- **Improved sleep apnea** and joint health.
- **Reduced severity of fatty liver disease**.

### How to achieve healthy weight loss?
Focus on three core components:
1. **Caloric restriction:** Prioritize nutrient-dense, healthy foods.
2. **Physical activity:** Combine aerobic and resistance exercises.
3. **Behavioral strategies:** Stay motivated and track your progress.

## 10. Macronutrient Distribution and Personalized Weight Loss Strategies

### How does macronutrient distribution impact weight loss?
Weight loss depends on both calorie reduction and the balance of macronutrients (protein, carbohydrates, and fats). Different macronutrient distributions can affect metabolism, appetite, and adherence to the diet. Below are some common diet types, their macronutrient ratios, example daily plans based on a 2,000 kcal intake, and their key benefits, considerations, and special concerns.

---

### **1. High-Protein Diet**
- **Macronutrient Ratio**:  
  - Protein: 30%  
  - Carbohydrates: 40%  
  - Fat: 30%
- **Daily Plan (2,000 kcal)**:  
  - Protein: 150g  
  - Carbohydrates: 200g  
  - Fat: 67g  
- **Key Takeaways**:  
  - **Benefits:** Promotes fat loss while preserving lean muscle mass. Increases satiety and thermogenesis, helping with appetite control.  
  - **Concerns:** High protein intake may stress kidney function in individuals with preexisting kidney conditions. Ensure hydration and balanced micronutrient intake to avoid deficiencies.

---

## 11. Adaptive Thermogenesis

### What is adaptive thermogenesis?
Adaptive thermogenesis refers to the body’s natural response to prolonged calorie deficits. During weight loss, the body reduces energy expenditure to preserve energy, making it harder to lose weight over time. This includes decreases in:
- **Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR):** The energy required to maintain basic bodily functions.
- **Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT):** Calories burned during daily activities like walking or fidgeting.
- **Thermic Effect of Food (TEF):** The energy used to digest, absorb, and metabolize food.

### Why is this important?
- Adaptive thermogenesis can slow weight loss, even if you stick to your calorie goals.
- Weight loss plateaus occur because your body adjusts its energy use to match lower calorie intake.

### How FitMomentum helps:
- Inform users about potential plateaus and how to overcome them.
- Suggest strategies like incorporating resistance training or adjusting calorie goals to maintain progress.

---

## 12. Exercise and Weight Loss

### Why is exercise important for weight loss?
Exercise increases energy expenditure, helps preserve lean muscle mass, and improves overall health. A combination of aerobic and resistance training provides the best results:
- **Aerobic Exercise:** Burns calories and reduces fat mass.
- **Resistance Training:** Preserves or builds muscle, which boosts metabolism.

### How FitMomentum helps:
- Provide tailored workout suggestions that combine aerobic and resistance exercises.
- Track and visualize calorie burn from exercise to motivate users.

**Reference:**  
Swift, D. L., Johannsen, N. M., Lavie, C. J., Earnest, C. P., & Church, T. S. (2014). The role of exercise and physical activity in weight loss and maintenance. *Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases, 56*(4), 441–447. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pcad.2013.09.012]

---

## 13. Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT)

### What is NEAT?
NEAT includes the calories burned through daily activities other than exercise, like walking, cleaning, or fidgeting. Increasing NEAT can significantly boost daily energy expenditure.

### Why is NEAT important?
- Small changes, like standing instead of sitting, can add up over time.
- NEAT accounts for a large portion of daily energy expenditure, especially in non-exercisers.

### How FitMomentum helps:
- Offer tips to increase NEAT, such as using a standing desk or taking walking breaks.
- Track and display NEAT-related activities for extra motivation.

---

## 16. Energy Density and Satiety

### What is energy density?
Energy density refers to the number of calories in a given weight of food. Low-energy-dense foods (like fruits and vegetables) help you feel full with fewer calories.

### Why does it matter?
- Replacing high-calorie foods with low-energy-dense options supports weight loss without hunger.

### How FitMomentum helps:
- Highlight low-energy-dense foods in meal planning tools.
- Educate users about how food choices impact satiety.

---

## 17. Sleep and Weight Loss

### How does sleep affect weight loss?
Sleep impacts hunger-regulating hormones:
- **Ghrelin:** Increases appetite when sleep-deprived.
- **Leptin:** Signals fullness, but decreases with poor sleep.

### Why does this matter?
- Poor sleep increases cravings and caloric intake, making weight loss harder.

### How FitMomentum helps:
- Include sleep tracking tools.
- Educate users on the importance of sleep for weight loss.

**Reference:**  
Taheri, S., Lin, L., Austin, D., Young, T., & Mignot, E. (2004). Short sleep duration is associated with reduced leptin, elevated ghrelin, and increased body mass index. *PLoS Medicine, 1*(3), e62. [https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0010062]

---

## 18. Body Composition vs. Scale Weight

### Why focus on body composition?
Scale weight alone doesn’t show the full picture. Body composition (fat mass vs. lean mass) provides better insight into health and progress.

### How FitMomentum helps:
- Allow users to log body composition metrics, like body fat percentage and muscle mass.
- Visualize progress through both weight and composition trends.
