# Scope Document: FitMomentum

## Project Overview
**FitMomentum** is an iPhone app designed to empower users on their weight loss journeys by providing visualizations, trend predictions, goal-setting features, and motivational tools using Apple HealthKit. The app aims to offer intuitive insights, maintain privacy and data security, and encourage consistency through engaging features.


---

## In-Scope Features
For the initial release, the app will include the following **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** features:
1. **Data Visualization:**
   - Visualize weight, body fat %, calories burned, and calories consumed using HealthKit data.
   - Display trends over time with intuitive graphs.

2. **Goal Setting and Recommendations:**
   - Allow users to set weight loss targets.
   - Provide feasible target recommendations (e.g., -1 lb/week or -2 lbs/week).

3. **Basic Analysis:**
   - Calculate BMI, BMR, and "ideal" weight based on age, sex, and height.
   - Generate milestones for weight loss targets.
   - Allow users to modify milestones by percentage or weight increments.

4. **Predictive Analytics:**
   - Graph trends to estimate goal and milestone completion dates.
   - Allow users to modify assumptions in predictive models for more personalized insights.

5. **Motivational Features:**
   - Display progress visualization with a hemiellipse-shaped progress bar ("rainbow arc") that fills as the user approaches their goal.
   - Animate the progress bar growth when progress is made, and celebrate milestone or goal completion with visual effects (e.g., stars, confetti) and haptic feedback.
   - Display motivational messages on the main dashboard, sliding into view when weight measurements are recorded or progress is updated.
   - Include a daily checklist for key tasks (e.g., log weight, log meals, hit step goal) that resets automatically each day.

6. **User Interface:**
   - Include subtle animations for a fluid, pleasant user experience.
   - Use a tabbed navigation layout consistent with Appleâ€™s design guidelines.

7. **Notifications:**
   - Provide daily notifications to remind users to log their weight or complete checklist tasks if unfinished by the end of the day.

## Out-of-Scope Features (for Initial Release)
The following features may be added post-launch:
1. **Achievements System:**
   - Unlock badges for consistent logging or reaching milestones.

2. **Data Export:**
   - Options to export data as PDFs or Excel spreadsheets.

3. **Advanced Dietary Guidance:**
   - Customize recommendations based on specific diets or detailed macronutrient preferences.

4. **Enhanced Onboarding Tutorials:**
   - Guided walkthroughs for new users.

---

## Technical Scope
1. **Third-Party Tools and Libraries:**
   - Use Apple HealthKit for data integration.
   - Explore lightweight libraries for graphing and statistical modeling if needed.

2. **Offline Functionality:**
   - Core features should work offline, except for viewing online support documents.

3. **Data Persistence:**
   - Health data is stored in Apple HealthKit.
   - User milestones, preferences, and app settings are stored locally on the device and optionally in the user's iCloud.

4. **Security and Privacy:**
   - No remote servers will store user health data.
   - App preferences and milestones will use encryption to ensure secure storage.
   - Users can lock the app with PIN, FaceID, or TouchID for additional privacy.

5. **Regulations:**
   - Regulatory requirements, including GDPR and HIPAA compliance, will be explored and implemented as needed.

---

## Constraints
1. **Development:**
   - Limited to a one-year timeline.
   - Solo development project with 20-40 hours per week allocated.

2. **Budget:**
   - Limited expenses, including domain and hosting costs and Apple Developer Program membership.

3. **Compatibility:**
   - Supports iPhones and iPads running iOS 18 or later.

---

## Assumptions
1. Users will:
   - Own HealthKit-enabled devices (e.g., iPhone, Apple Watch, Bluetooth scale).
   - Be familiar with apps like MyFitnessPal and Apple Health.

2. All HealthKit data is accurate and provided by other apps or devices.

3. App preferences and user-generated targets will sync to iCloud if possible.

4. Predictive modeling will use simple, publicly available statistical methods.

---

## Risks
1. **Skill and Experience:**
   - Limited iOS development experience may slow implementation.

2. **Timeline:**
   - Developing the app within one year as a solo project is challenging.

3. **App Store Approval:**
   - Apple's review process may delay publication.

4. **Budget Constraints:**
   - The project is self-funded with minimal expenses planned.
